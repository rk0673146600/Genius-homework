          Defer loading of the iframe until it reaches a calculated distance
          from the visual viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to
          avoid using the network and storage bandwidth required to fetch the
          frame until the browser is reasonably certain that it will be needed.
          This improves the performance and cost in most typical use cases, in
          particular by reducing initial page load times.
